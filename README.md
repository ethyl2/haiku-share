## HAIKU SHARE

This is project to celebrate my favorite type of poetry: haiku!

Contributions are highly welcome!

This is a brand-new project!
Future features:

1. Section/page on how to write a haiku
2. Ability to submit haiku to be on this website.
    Possible fields:
    - Title
    - Haiku
    - Category
    - Author
    - Image

3. Section that displays haikus, both submitted here in code and submitted by website users
4. Uses an image API to get images that can be included with haikus.
5. Section with bios of featured haiku authors.
6. Section that has a haiku generator, where users can enter(or select from, most likely) nouns, verbs, etc. and a haiku could be made.
7. What else?

Contributions for design, assets (such as favicons), and haiku themselves would be awesome!
